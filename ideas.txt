adjust the helper.py file, add on disk caching to as many functions as possible.
  - get regions, get AD's
  - more complicated ones (compute, block storage) ... not sure how to do this yet

  - add per function call caching capability
    - maybe have a case block in a generic cache call function, handle all disk/caching from there
